What resistor to use for the base?

With the 2N2222 which allow 650 mA and has a gain of 100,
we need to send 6.5 mA of current to the base to turn it to 100%.
1k Ohm => 5 mA

With the N3904 which allow 200 mA and has a gain of 100,
we need to send 2 mA of current to the base to turn it to 100%.
1k Ohm at base   =>  140 mA
470 Ohm at base  =>  173 mA
0
