- Tutorial: https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/counter/bcd-counter-circuit.html
- For 1 clock A cycle increment the ouput, clock B must also be clocked
  every other time, therefore we connect BIT_0(pin 12) to Clock B.
- Chaining 2 SN74LS90N, bit3(pin 11, QD) is connected to Clock A 
  of the second SN74LS90N, the Clock A will be clocked for 8 and 9,
  which will increment the second counter by one.
