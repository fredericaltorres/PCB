- For 1 clock A cycle increment the ouput, clock B must also be clocked
  every other time, therefore we connect BIT_0(pin 12) to Clock B.
- Chaining 2 SN74LS90N, bit3(pin 11, QD) is connected to Clock A 
  of the second SN74LS90N, the Clock A will be clocked HIGH for 8 
  and remain HIGH for 9, then clock low when reseting to 0.
  Therefore clocking once the clock A on the second SN74LS90N
