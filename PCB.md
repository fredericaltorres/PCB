This case you want to use, do you intend to use something similar 
in the future.

I had an idea that we make the mounting holes elongated.   
This would allow room to adjust the board within the enclosure and 
allow you to adjust the USB Connector perfectly flush with the edge.

You have given me a tremendous amount of space to work with, enough to 
add additional connectors, perhaps both a male and female header, test 
points, etc.

It is not that important to retain the IC positioning, but I do recommend 
you retain the exact pre-existing connector positioning to maintain 
compatibility.

Think about these new capabilities and when we talk tomorrow we will 
finalize an initial design.
